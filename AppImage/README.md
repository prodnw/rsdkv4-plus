# Building
Copy your compiled linux binary, and copy it to `/AppDir/usr/bin/RSDKv4`
(create the `/bin` folder if it does not exist)

Run `build.sh` from this directory inside a terminal
(to run, enter `./build.sh`)

Enter an icon filename

And the build should be in this directory, named `RSDKv4.AppImage`
